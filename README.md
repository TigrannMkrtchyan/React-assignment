## Specific Tasks
1. **Visual Design** 
<br>Your application should closely resemble the provided design.

2. **Stops List** 
<br>Please refer to the [stops_list.json](https://gitlab.routetitan.com/hiring/react-assignment/-/blob/master/stops_list.json?ref_type=heads) file provided in this project to import the list of delivery stops. This file contains all necessary details for each stop, including sequence, estimated time of arrival (ETA), time window, street address, zipcode, city, and coordinates.

<br>On clicking the 'Complete' button, please mimic the ticket transition displayed on the second screen of the design.

5. **Map View** <br>
Show all delivery locations with markers on a map and connect the markers with straight lines in sequence.
<br>- Interactive Map: use MapLibre GL JS for map interaction (markers, lines), details can be found [here](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/)
<br>- Tiles: Use `https://tiles.stadiamaps.com/styles/osm_bright.json` as the style URL in MapLibre GL JS
